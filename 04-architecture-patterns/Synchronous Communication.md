# Synchronous Communication

Imagine you’re calling your friend on the phone to ask a question. You both must be present at the same time, and you wait for their answer before moving forward in the conversation. This is synchronous communication.  

In system design, **synchronous communication** means two or more components interact in real-time, where the sender sends a request and waits until the receiver processes and responds. The communication is tightly coupled — if one side is unavailable, the process is delayed.  

A common real-world analogy is a **restaurant order**: you tell the waiter your order and wait until the waiter confirms and notes it down before you leave. If the waiter doesn’t respond, you are stuck waiting.  

### Types of Synchronous Communication

## 1. Request-Response Pattern
This is the **most common synchronous pattern**. A client sends a request, and the server replies immediately with data or confirmation.

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you’re at a coffee shop:  
- You order a cappuccino.  
- The barista confirms your order and notes it down before preparing.  
- You don’t leave until you know they got it.  

### System Example:
- A browser sends an HTTP GET request to a server (`/users/123`).  
- The server queries the database and returns JSON with user details.  
- Until the response is received, the client waits.  

### Where Used:
- REST APIs  
- gRPC (with blocking calls)  
- Database queries (SQL select/update)  



## 2. Real-Time Request-Reply (Interactive Pattern)
Here, both client and server interact in **real-time sessions** where responses are immediate and continuous.  

### Real-Life Example:
A **customer service phone call**:  
- You call customer care.  
- The agent replies instantly to each question.  
- Both of you need to stay connected until the issue is resolved.  

### System Example:
- **WebSockets**: A chat application where messages are exchanged instantly.  
- **Online gaming servers**: Player actions are sent to the server, and responses are returned immediately.  

### Where Used:
- Chat applications (Slack, WhatsApp web sessions).  
- Multiplayer games.  
- Customer support bots with real-time conversations.  



## 3. Blocking Function Calls (Code-Level Synchronous Communication)
At the programming level, many function calls are synchronous by default: the program **pauses** until the call finishes.

### Real-Life Example:
Using an **ATM machine**:  
- You insert your card and request ₹1000 withdrawal.  
- The ATM won’t let you proceed to the next step until it verifies with the bank and confirms the transaction.  

### System Example:
```python
def get_user_details(user_id):
    response = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id={user_id}")
    return response
Here, the program waits for the database to return results before moving to the next line.

```
### Where Used:
- Function calls in programming languages.

- Database queries.

- Network requests in synchronous code execution.

## 4. Point-to-Point Direct Calls
This happens when one service directly calls another service and waits for the response.

### Real-Life Example:
You knock on your neighbor’s door to borrow sugar. You can’t leave until they either give you sugar or say they don’t have any.

### System Example:
- Microservice A calls microservice B via HTTP/gRPC to fetch data.
- If B is down, A gets stuck.

### Where Used:
- Microservice architectures.

- Legacy service-to-service integrations.

## 5. Transactional / Confirmational Synchronous Communication
This pattern is about ensuring confirmation before proceeding with critical steps.

### Real-Life Example:
- Booking a flight ticket online:

- You choose a seat and click "Pay".

- The airline system must synchronously confirm your payment before reserving the seat.

- If payment fails, no ticket is booked.

### System Example:
- Banking transactions (debit/credit card payments).

- E-commerce checkout flows.

### Where Used:
- Finance, healthcare, e-commerce.

- Any system requiring strong consistency.

## 6. Synchronous Orchestration
Here, a central controller synchronously calls multiple services in sequence.

### Real-Life Example:
A wedding planner coordinating with the florist, caterer, and decorator. They confirm with each vendor one by one before finalizing.

### System Example:
An API Gateway making sequential synchronous calls to:

- Payment Service

- Order Service

- Notification Service

### Where Used:
- Microservice orchestrations.

- Workflow engines (e.g., AWS Step Functions in synchronous mode).



## Why do we need Synchronous Communication?
Synchronous communication is required when:  
- Immediate feedback or confirmation is critical.  
- Operations cannot proceed without the result of another system.  
- Reliability and transactional guarantees are more important than speed.  

For example, imagine making a **payment** on an e-commerce website. The system must synchronously confirm whether the payment is successful before allowing you to place the order. If synchronous communication wasn’t used, you might confirm your order without actually paying — leading to chaos for both customers and sellers.  

Without synchronous communication in critical workflows, systems may:  
- Process incomplete or incorrect data.  
- Cause confusion between users and services.  
- Fail in transactional operations like banking, medical systems, or booking flights.  

## How does it work?
Step-by-step process:  
1. **Sender initiates request** → like an API call.  
2. **Receiver processes the request** → database query, computation, or external service.  
3. **Receiver sends response back** → success, failure, or data.  
4. **Sender resumes workflow** only after receiving the response.  

Open-source diagrams (like sequence diagrams) can help visualize synchronous flow.  

## Relation to System Engineering / System Design
Synchronous communication is a **core pattern** in system design:  
- Used for **API calls**, **database queries**, and **inter-service calls** in microservices.  
- Ensures **real-time consistency** between systems.  
- Often balanced with asynchronous methods for performance optimization.  

## Before Synchronous Communication vs After Synchronous Communication
**Before:**  
- Systems worked independently without waiting for each other.  
- Leads to misalignment, missing confirmations, and inconsistent states.  

**After:**  
- Ensures both sides agree before proceeding.  
- Makes systems more **predictable** and **reliable**, though sometimes slower.  

## Main Motive / Goal
The main motive is **reliability and real-time interaction**.  
It ensures that one part of the system knows for sure the status or result of another before continuing.  

## Advantages
- Predictable and reliable responses.  
- Simpler to design compared to async flows.  
- Easier debugging (step-by-step request/response).  
- Strong consistency guarantees.  

## Disadvantages
- High latency (sender must wait).  
- Tightly coupled (if one service is down, the whole flow fails).  
- Scalability challenges under heavy load.  
- May lead to bottlenecks in distributed systems.  

## How to implement Synchronous Communication
Steps to implement:  
1. **Choose protocol:** HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC, WebSocket for real-time.  
2. **Design API contracts:** Define request/response clearly.  
3. **Error handling:** Include retries, timeouts, and fallbacks.  
4. **Load balancing:** Prevent single server overload.  
5. **Testing:** Simulate both success and failure flows.  

Approaches:  
- REST API calls for simple synchronous requests.  
- gRPC for high-performance microservice synchronous communication.  
- WebSockets for real-time bi-directional synchronous messaging.
